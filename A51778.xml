         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(who could detect his dealing in the premiſſes) being abſent, and kept out of the way, be the ſaid J.H. upon advantage therein, and in purſuance of their plot aforeſaid, doth now pretend and give out in ſpeeches, that the ſaid Bonds were real Securities, and entred into for juſt debts, and that your Orator, and the ſaid B.B. and I.I. or ſome one of them, had of the ſaid H. Money or Commodities of the value of Money mentioned in the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſaid Bonds, which money he pretendeth to be ſtill unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and the ſaid Bonds thereby forfeited; and thereupon he the ſaid I.H. hath of late arreſted your Orator, and commenceth, or threatneth to commence and proſecute ſeveral Sutes againſt him at the Common Law upon the ſaid ſeveral Bonds, and ſpareing the ſaid G.B.

And although it may not be abſolutely perfect upon the firſt Eſſay, yet it may anſwer beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, there never having been any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Additions.</p>

                     <head>Of a Fine.</head>
                     <p>A Fine being of all kinds of Settlements of the greateſt Force and Antiquity, is ſometimes called <hi>Compoſitio ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabilis,</hi> but more uſually <hi>finalis Concordia,</hi> and is ſo termed as the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> holds, <hi>Quia finem litibus imponit:</hi> And ſo indeed it did antiently; for after ſome contention had been about a thing by Suit, the Parties agreeing who ſhould have it, a Fine was levied, and ſo there was an end of the matter: but is now of more common uſe; becauſe a man thereby may convey his Lands to another in Fee-ſimple, Fee-tail, for life or years, and that with a Reſervation of Rent alſo, <hi>Co. Inſt.</hi> 2. Part, 511, 514. And any perſon that hath a Capacity to take by the Grant of a Deed, and may be a good Grantee in a Deed, ſuch perſon may be a good Conuſee in a Fine, and may thereby have and take the thing gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And may be levied of all things whereof either a <hi>Praecipe quod Reddat;</hi> a <hi>Praecipe quod faciat;</hi> a <hi>Praecipe quod Permittat;</hi> or a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe quod Teneat</hi> lyeth. And the order of proceeding in ſuing it out, is thus:</p>
                     <p>Firſt an <hi>Original</hi> is ſued forth, which may be either a <hi>Quid juris clamat; Per quae Servitia; De Rationabilibus diviſis; Writ of Right Patent or Cloſe; Warrantia Chartae, De Conſuetudinibus,</hi> or any Writ of Right: But the uſual Writ at this day is a Writ of Covenant. And although by the common courſe they uſe to take out a <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Poteſtatem,</hi> and to have the Conuſance of a Fine before any Original ſued forth, yet the Original is alwayes ſuppoſed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Law to precede the <hi>Dedimus;</hi> and therefore doth and muſt bear Teſte before it, or it will be erronious. Then there is a <hi>Praecipe</hi> drawn, and the Concord and Agreement of the Parties, both which are to be fairly written in Parchment. After this, the Conuſor or Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Fine are to come in perſon before the Judge or Judges authorized to take the Conuſance of Fines, who are to take notice of the perſons, that there be no Infants, Ideots or Madmen among
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:97669:336"/>them; nor any Feme Covert, for if there be ſuch a Woman, the Judges or Commiſſioners are to examine her privately and apart, Whether ſhe be free and willing to do it without any conſtraint of her Husband? Then ſhe with the reſt of the Conuſors declare publikely their conſent, and to ſubſcribe their Names or Marks to the Concord: And if it be by <hi>Dedimus Poteſtatem,</hi> it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and certified under the hands and ſeals of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into the Common Pleas, that it may there be recorded and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Which done, the Conuſee muſt compound with the King for his Licenſe, and the money paid thereupon is called the Kings Silver; and of this an Entry muſt be made on the back of the Writ of Covenant. Then it muſt be enrolled by the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> and upon that Roll the Proclamations are to be indorſed; And thence carried to the Chirographers who make a Note thereof commonly called, <hi>The Note of the Fine:</hi> And then enter it upon Record, ingroſs it, and make and deliver the Indentures thereof to the Conuſee: And if it be a Fine with Proclamations, it muſt be proclaimed openly in the Common-Pleas, once every fourth Term then next following. And the next Term after the engroſſing, the contents thereof are to be recorded in a Table made for that purpoſe to be ſet up in the Court of Common-Pleas at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in an open place all the Term time; and ſo at every Aſſiſes.</p>
                     <p>The Fine alſo (if the Parties pleaſe) may be enrolled and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified.</p>

                     <p>THis Indenture Tripartite made, &amp;c. between A. B. of C. and D. his wife of the firſt part; E.F. of G. and H. his wife of the ſecond part, and J. K. and L.

Whereas the ſaid A.B. and D. his wife, having in the Term of St. <hi>Hill.</hi> &amp;c. laſt paſt knowledged a Fine in due form of Law, of all thoſe Six Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuages or Tenements called, &amp;c. with the appurtenances, and of Seven Cottages and one Curtilage with the appurtenances, in the Pariſh of, &amp;c. to the ſaid I.K. and L.M. and the heirs of the ſaid L.

(<hi>prout antea,</hi> and here make your neceſſary recitals,) Now his Indenture witneſſeth, and it is hereby declared, &amp;c. That the uſe and uſes, intent and purpoſe of the ſaid Fine is, and is by theſe preſents declared, limited and appointed to be to the uſe and uſes, intents and purpoſes hereafter in theſe preſents limited and appointed, and to no other uſe or uſes, intents or purpoſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; that is to ſay, <hi>(here recite and declare the uſes)</hi> And the true intent and meaning of the ſaid Fine farther is, and by theſe preſents is declared to be, to the intent that he the ſaid E. Brother of the ſaid A. and S. his wife, ſhall and may have and perceive for and
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:97669:339"/>during the term of their natural lives and the longer liver of them, one annual Rent or Summe of, &amp;c. to be iſſuing out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes yearly at the four uſual Feaſts or Terms in the Year, and to begin at the firſt of the ſaid Feaſts which ſhall be next after the death of the ſaid A. And if the ſaid Rent or any part thereof be behind or unpaid, &amp;c. that then the ſaid E. ſhall diſtrain in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes or any part thereof as for a Rent-charge: and alſo that he the ſaid E. ſhall have and enjoy one Meſſuage, &amp;c. for his natural life, &amp;c. In witneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This I take to be ſufficient as to Preſidents, I will now ſhew what is moſt neceſſary to be known in this particular, wherein I will give you ſeveral Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place, take notice that Uſes may be thus declared on a Fine, Feoffment or Recovery of Land: but upon a Bargain and Sale no declaration can be of any other uſe than what the Law doth make upon it. So upon a Covenant of Uſes no declaration may be of other uſes than what are in the Deed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That whoever may diſpoſe of Land, may diſpoſe of the uſe thereof, for the declaration of the uſe doth follow the Land.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That although ſuch declaration may be made by words, yet it is not ſafe to do it otherwiſe than by Deed Indented.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This may be made before, at or after the time of the making the aſſurance. As for Example, One may Covenant or agree that A. ſhall recover his Land againſt him, or that he will levy a Fine or make a Feoffment of it to him, and that the ſame ſhall be to the uſe of himſelf or others. And if one make a Feoffment, he may declare the uſes of it at the ſame time, and that within the ſame or another Deed at his pleaſure. And if the aſſurance be paſt, and no declaration had before or at the time of paſſing it, a declaration may be ſubſequent, and ſuch declaration or Indenture may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and direct the Uſes of a Fine and Recovery, but with this difference, <hi>viz.</hi> Where precedent Indentures are made to direct the uſes of a ſubſequent aſſurance; and after the aſſurance is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, there no averment ſhall be received by word, that the ſame Aſſurance was to other uſes than are declared by the Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But againſt an Indenture ſubſequent declaring the uſes of the aſſurance precedent, an Averment may be taken that there were other Uſes limited before or at the time of the aſſurance, than are contained in the Indenture.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The declaration of Uſes by Indenture muſt be certain in the
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:97669:340"/>perſons to whom; in the Lands, &amp;c. of which; and in the eſtates and time for which the uſes are declared: and it muſt be compleat and certain, without reference to any other; for incertainty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes all.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When an Indenture Precedent is to limit the uſes of a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Fine or Recovery, and it is not purſued in ſome circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time, Perſon, Quantity or the like; yet if no other new mean agreement be proved to intervene, the aſſurance ſhall be to the uſes in the ſame Indenture: But if the Variance be in theſe particulars, and the form of the Indenture be not purſued, there an Averment may be received that it was to other uſes than what are contained in the Indenture; and if none ſuch can be made, then is it left to conſtruction of Law.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And for the Parties to the Indentures to lead ſuch uſes, take this, That a Deed to lead the uſe of a fine, may be either by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument Poll or Indented; and the Indented may be either ſingle, of two parts, of three parts called Tripartite, or four parts called Quadripartite, or of more parts, as the caſe is, thus; This Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c. between A. of the one part, and B. of the ſecond part. Or Tripartite, as, This Indenture, &amp;c. between A. of the firſt part, B. of the ſecond, and D. of the third part. Or Quadripartite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween A. of the firſt part, C. of the ſecond part, E. of the third part, and G. of the fourth part, and ſo to name all the perſons (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the common Vouchee) that bear any part in the Deed, Fine or Recovery. And ſo in all other matters as the caſe is, the Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to be drawn up.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, I will cite Six or Seven Caſes in this Point, and ſo go on to the next head.</p>

But if a fine be levied to other perſons, or at another time, it may be well averred by Paroll to be to other uſes: For in the firſt caſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture is directory to the fine; and in the other caſe it is but Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Cro.</hi> 2.29.</p>

                           </gap>lio Juris,</hi> being a certain form uſed for the better aſſuring of Lands or Tenements upon any man. And this Recovery by aſſent is now by common uſage a kind of conveyance upon which a uſe may be limited and averred. And there is a great difference between a Recovery by aſſent, and a Recovery without aſſent, though without title. <hi>Co.</hi> 1. Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Pelhams</hi> Caſe 14.</p>
                     <p>In the formalities whereof three things or parties are required, <hi>viz.</hi> a Demandant, a Tenant, and a Vouchee, as efficient cauſes thereof, and the Land demanded as the matter thereof.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Demandant is he that brings the Writ of Entry, and may be termed properly enough the Recoveror.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Tenant is he againſt whom the Writ is brought, and may be ſtiled the Recoverce.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Vouchee is he whom the Tenant voucheth or calleth to warranty for the Land in demand: And it is either with a ſingle Voucher, which is where the Writ is brought againſt him that is to paſs the Land immediately, and he doth vouch over the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vouchee: And ſometimes with a double Voucher, which is when the writ is brought againſt another to whom he that is to paſs the Land hath aliened it, and he doth vouch him that is to make the aſſurance, and he doth vouch over the common Vouchee; and this is the ſureſt and ſafeſt kind of Recovery: And this may be alſo with a treble Vouchee.</p>
                     <p>And here obſerve, That a Common Recovery is much of the nature of a Fine, and hath much favour from the Law at this day, and is in ſome reſpects better than a Fine; for a fine will barre the Heir in tail, but not him in Remainder or Reverſion; but a Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very bars them all. <hi>Co.</hi> 1.22.62.</p>
                     <p>The method of ſuffering a Recovery, and the manner and order of proceeding therein is as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There muſt be a Writ of Entry, and therein a Demandant, a Tenant and a Vouchee, for if either of theſe be wanting, it is not a compleat Recovery; and ſuch perſons and by ſuch names may be Demandants, Tenants and Vouchees in Recoveries as may be Cogniſors and Cogniſees in Fines. <hi>Co. upon Litt.</hi> 372. But the perſons and parties muſt be competent and capable, and there muſt be a lawful Tenant to the <hi>Praecipe.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="676" facs="tcp:97669:343"/>2. In the Writ of Entry there muſt be Land contained, or ſome other thing demanded, and that ſuch as is demandable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to take notice, That of ſuch things and by ſuch names as a Writ of Covenant for the levying of a fine may be had, a Writ of Entry for ſuffering a Recovery may be had. See <hi>Doctor and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> 52. <hi>Mores Rep.</hi> 953.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It muſt not contain the ſame thing twice, as to name a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage and a Houſe parcel of the ſame Meſſuage, nor a Town and a Hamlet within the ſame Town.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If the Writ of Entry be returnable <hi>Craſtino Martini,</hi> the Writ of Summons <hi>ad Warrant.</hi> thereupon muſt bear <hi>Teſte</hi> from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of <hi>Craſt. Mart.</hi> and be returnable nine returns after the return of the Writ of Entry <hi>incluſivè,</hi> that is, accounting <hi>Craſt. Mart.</hi> for one of the nine returns, and <hi>Tres Paſchae</hi> which is the ninth return after <hi>Craſt. Mart.</hi> for another. And the Teſte of the Writ of Seiſin muſt be the day of that ninth return, and be returnable fifteen days after. If a ſingle Recovery and a Fine be againſt the Tenant, the Writ of Entry muſt bear date and Teſte before the Writ of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and be returned before it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If a Writ of Covenant be brought againſt the Tenant, and a Writ of Entry againſt the Demandant, then the Writ of Covenant muſt bear date and be returned before the Writ of Entry; and this is called the double Voucher.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That all Writs of Entry muſt be ſigned by the Kings Attorney before they be ſealed, and Fines to the King are to be paid upon them as upon Writs of Covenant. The Warrant of Attorney by the Clerk of the Warrants, and the Writ of Entry, Summons and Seiſin are to be returned and filed with the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> and the Judgment to be entred by the Prothonorary.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That in a Recovery with a double Voucher, the fine muſt be ſued firſt to make him Tenant to the Writ of Entry, brought either by right or wrong: for every Writ of Entry muſt be brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes againſt him that is Tenant of the Freehold of the Land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at the time of the Writ brought, he muſt be at leaſt Tenant for life, or a Diſſeiſor of the Land whereof the Recovery is had, for the Eſtate of the Tenant in tail which is vouched is barted in reſpect of the Aſſets onely, which are or may be recovered in value end of execution ſued by the Tenant againſt him. <hi>Plow.</hi> 11. <hi>Dyer</hi> 252.

                     <p>Secondly, That in theſe caſes there muſt be two Atturneys at the leaſt, and to give them an authority joyntly and ſeverally, that if one of them dye before the Recovery be ſuffered, the other may have power to do it.

                     <p>Fourthly, The Recovery thus ſuffered by the parties in perſon or by their Attorneys, the ſame muſt be entred by one of the Clerks of the Court of Common Pleas upon the Rolls of the ſame Court, there to remain upon Record.</p>

                        <p>To the third Point, <hi>Dodderidge</hi> held, That this Recovery ſhould barr <hi>William,</hi> for he had but a poſſibility to have a Fee, and as it were a contingent Eſtate, which is deſtroyed by this Recovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came in <hi>eſſe:</hi> for otherwiſe it would be a miſchievous kind of Perpetuity which could not by any means be deſtroyed.

But all the other Juſtices were herein againſt him, That this Recovery ſhall not bind, for he who ſuffered the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very had a Fee, and <hi>William Brown</hi> had but a Poſſibility if he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived <hi>Thomas;</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> dying without iſſue in his life, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in value ſhall extend in value thereto, unleſs he had been party by way of Vouchee; (And then it ſhould, for by entring into the Warranty he gave all his poſſibility) Therefore they agreed to the caſe which <hi>Davenport</hi> at the Barre cited to be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:97669:350"/>34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> where a Mortgagee ſuffers a Recovery that ſhall no bind the Mortgagor; but if he had been party by way of Voucher, it had been otherwiſe: and here is not any Eſtate depending upon the Eſtate of <hi>Thomas Bray,</hi> but a Collaterall and meer Poſſibility which ſhall not be toucht by a Recovery: And if ſuch a Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould be allow'd, then if a man ſhould deviſe that his Heir ſhould make ſuch a payment to his younger ſons, or to his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, otherwiſe the Land ſhould be unto them: if the Heir by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery might avoid it, it would be very miſchievous, and might fruſtrate all devices: and there is no ſuch miſchief, that it ſhould maintain Perpetuities; for it is but in a Particular caſe, and upon a mere contingency, which perchance never may happen and be avoided by joyning him in the Recovery who hath ſuch a contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency: And on the other part, it would be far more and a greater miſchief that all Executors deviſes ſhould by ſuch means be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd: And <hi>Hutton</hi> in his Argument put this Caſe; If a man gives or deviſes Land to one and his heirs, as long as J. S. hath Iſſue of his body, he by Recovery ſhall not bind him, who made this Gift without making him a party by way of Vouchee; for a Recovery againſt Tenant in Fee-ſimple never ſhall bind a collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſt, title or poſſibility, as a Condition or Covenant, or the like. Wherefore they all, beſides <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> held, that this Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was no barr. But it was adjudged for the Defendant. <hi>Pells</hi> and <hi>Brown, Hill.</hi> 17 <hi>Jac.</hi> B.R. <hi>Cro.</hi> 2 Part, 590.</p>

                     <p>The Method of proceeding in a Judgment is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> The Judgment being paſt, the Plaintiff may chooſe his Execution, and to purſue it; But he is firſt to take care that this Judgment be entred in due and legal form, which you may ſee in the Book of Entries.

And this muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully done, the finding muſt have certainty in it by the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Land, as the Mannor of H. a Meſſuage and 20 Acres of Land, Meadow and Paſture in D. in the occupation of J.

Then the Sheriff is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the ſame time or ſome time afterward to deliver the one moyety thereof; and this laſt he alone doth without the Jury. And herein care muſt be had that they do it by meets and bounds: and that he do certainly deſcribe that which he doth ſo deliver, and that he deliver what is divideable; and therefore that he do not divide a Mannor and deliver the moyety thereof, for by this means he may deſtroy the Mannor. And if the Sheriff ſhall deliver too much, the Court at the return of the Writ may quaſh it, and order a new Inquiry.</p>
                     <p>When the Plaintiff is ſatisfied, by incurſion of time, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant may re-enter upon his Land without more ado; but if he hath received ſatisfaction by ſome accidental improvement of the Land, there he is to call the party into Court out of which the Writ iſſued, and there to do it by <hi>Scire facias.

Howbeit this Act ſhall not extend to Lands ſold <hi>bona fide</hi> (after the Judgment given) when the money raiſed thereupon is paid or ſecured to be paid to Creditors in diſcharge of due debts.</p>

And this moſtly goeth forth before Judgment, and in ſome caſes after Judgment. If it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judgment, there muſt go before it three Writs of <hi>Capias ad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondendum,</hi> with a <hi>Non eſt inventus</hi> upon each of them returned.

                     <p>The <hi>Capias pro fine</hi> is where a Judgment is given in a Caſe for a Plaintiff, and it is in ſuch a caſe where the Defendant is alſo to pay a Fine to the King; the which being not paid, to command the Sheriff to take and impriſon him till he pay his Fine to the King, <hi>Co.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Extendi facias</hi> is that which is called the Writ of Extent, whereby the value of Lands, &amp;c. is commanded to be made and levied: For to extend doth ſignifie in Law to value the Lands or Tenements of one bound by Statute, &amp;c. who hath forfeited his Bond to ſuch an indifferent rate as by the yearly Rent the Obligor may in time be paid his debt, <hi>F.N.B.</hi> 131.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Extent</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie a Writ to the Sheriff for the valuing of Lands or Tenements; and ſometimes the Act of the Sheriff upon this Writ.

                     <p n="3">3. The Sheriff upon a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> may not deliver the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:97669:358"/>Goods to the Plaintiff in ſatisfaction of his debt, <hi>Cro.</hi> 1. part, 504.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

If the Sheriff have a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> or a <hi>Ca. ſa.</hi> againſt a man, and before Execution executed, he pay him the money; in this caſe the Sheriff cannot do execution after; if he do, an Action of Treſpaſs or Falſe Impriſonment lyeth againſt, <hi>per</hi> Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Berkley,</hi> B.R.

A new Execution may be ſued againſt any man who by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of Parliament ſhall be ſet at liberty. Stat. 5 <hi>Jac.</hi> cap. 13.</p>
                     <p>If the Sheriff hath a man in his cuſtody by proceſs of Law, and after this a Writ of <hi>Capias ad Satisfaciendum</hi> is delivered to him; in this caſe in Judgment of Law, he ſhall be in Execution preſently upon that Writ, though he never make any actual arreſt thereupon. <hi>Co.</hi> 5.89.</p>

                        <p>If the Defendant pay the money, by this he ſhall be diſcharged of the Execution. So a Releaſe of all Executions will barr in this caſe, although it be in the Kings caſe. But a Releaſe of all Suits will not diſcharge from Execution in the caſe of the King or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Co.</hi> 8.153.

But if he make any <hi>Depheaſance,</hi> Releaſe or other ſuch like act to the Defendant being in Execution, amounting to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Execution; this will not be in it ſelf <hi>ipſo facto</hi> a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Execution: but this will make way for his diſcharge by <hi>Audita Querela</hi> or ſome other means.

In a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Recogniſance, Joynt-Tenancy is a good plea to abate the Writ; and if it be upon a Judgment to have Execution, it is a good barr that the Plaintiff hath aſſigned his da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to the King, although the King have not levied: So alſo it is a good barr to ſay that the Sheriff hath levied the money by <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> albeit he hath not returned the Writ. <hi>Moores Rep.</hi> 671, 693.</p>

                     <p>But this ſhall ſuffice as to thoſe Particulars. I will now ſhew you what is liable to Execution upon a Statute or Recogniſance, and when and how. Wherein take notice,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That when a man doth enter into a Statute or Recogniſance, the Land of the Conuſor is not the debtor, but the Body: And the Land is lyable onely in reſpect that it is in the hands of the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or at the time of the acknowledging of the Statute or afterwards: and the Land is not charged with the debt, but chargeable onely, at the election of the Conuſee: but the perſon is chargeable, and the Land in reſpect of the perſon. And therefore although the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſor
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:97669:362"/>alien his Land to another, yet he remains debtor ſtill, and his body and goods ſhall be taken in Execution. <hi>Plow.</hi> 72.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the body of the Conuſor himſelf, (but not the body of his Heir, Executor or Adminiſtrator) is lyable to Execution, and may be taken, although there be Lands, Goods and Chattels to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the debt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That all the Demeſne Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments corporeal and incorporeal of the Conuſor that are grantable over, as his Mannors, Meſſuages, Lands, meadows, Paſtures, Woods, Rents, Commons, Tythes, Advowſons and the like; alſo his Goods and Chattels, as Leaſes for years, and all his Emblements, Cattel, Houſholdſtuff and the like, and Wardſhips when they were in being, are lyable to Execution upon a Statute. But Annuities, Offices in Truſt, Seigniories in Frank-almoigne, Homage, Fealty, Right to Land, things in action and ſuch like are not liable to ſuch Execution. <hi>Co.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Plow.</hi> 72. <hi>Co.</hi> 2.59. <hi>Litt.</hi> Sect. 318. <hi>Dyer</hi> 7.205. <hi>Co. on Litt.</hi> 174. <hi>Doct. &amp; Stud.</hi> 53. <hi>Co.</hi> 2.

                     <p n="4">4. All the Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments which the Conuſor had at the time of the Recogniſance entred into or at any time after, in whoſe hands ſoever, or by what means ſoever the ſame are come at the time of the Execution, ſhall be ſubject and lyable to the Execution. But the Lands which the Conuſor had and did put away before the time of the Statute or Recogniſance entred into are not lyable: And all the Goods and Chattels the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor hath or are found in his hands at the time when the Execution is to be made by <hi>Extendi facias</hi> are lyable: But the Goods and Chattels he had and did <hi>bona fide</hi> do away before the time of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution done, are not lyable to the Execution. <hi>Co.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Conuſee upon other Recognizances ſhall have the ſame things in execution as a man ſhall have after a Judgment in a Suit in the Kings-Bench or Common Pleas, by <hi>Fieri facias</hi> or <hi>Levari facias,</hi> all his Goods and Chattels, and by <hi>Elegit</hi> the moiety of his Lands and all his Chattels, beſides the Cattel of his Plow and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of Husbandry: But in theſe caſes he cannot take the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Conuſor in Execution, unleſs it be upon a new Suit, or in caſe of Bayl in the Kings Bench. <hi>Plow.</hi> 72. <hi>Co.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Dyer</hi> 306.</p>
                     <p>In the next place I will ſhew you the Method how a Statute or Recognizance is to be executed, and all the proceedings thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherein obſerve,</p>
                     <p>That Recogniſances are of two ſorts: 1. Such as are uſually
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:97669:363"/>taken in the Kings Courts of Record at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> 2. Such as are in the nature of a Statute ſtaple by the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>The proceedings upon the Statute Staple and the Recogniſance founded on the 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. aforeſaid, in the execution thereof are in the ſame manner as the proceedings in the Statute Merchant, which I mention hereafter; but with theſe differences:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Upon the execution of the Statute-Merchant there iſſues forth a <hi>Capias</hi> againſt the Body before any execution be made of the Lands or Goods and Chattels; and the Lands and goods cannot be extended till a quarter of a year be paſt after the Body is taken, or the Sheriff have teturned a <hi>Non eſt Inventus.</hi> But upon the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Statute-Staple and the Recogniſance, the Body, goods and Lands may be taken altogether at once.</p>
                     <p>Then ſecondly, Upon a Statute-Merchant one may have an Action of debt, but otherwiſe it is of a Statute-ſtaple.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, The <hi>Capias</hi> upon the Statute-Merchant may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> or <hi>Common-Pleas;</hi> but the Writ of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> upon the other is to be returnable in Chancery. <hi>F.N.B.</hi> 130, 131. <hi>Co. on Litt</hi> 290.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That in a Statute-Staple, preſently after the Certificate into the Chancery, the Conuſee ſhall have a Writ to take his body and extend his Lands and Goods returnable in Chancery, which is a Commiſſion directed to the Sheriff of the County where the Goods and Lands lye, for the valuing thereof, whereby they ſhall be appriſed at a reaſonable rate by a Jury of ſworn men impanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Sheriff for that purpoſe; which Inquiſition returned by the Sheriff, he may take and deliver the Lands and Goods to the Conuſee; To hold the ſame till he be ſatisfied of his debt and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages: or if he refuſe, the Conuſee may force him to it by a <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Dyer</hi> 180. <hi>Co.</hi> 4.67.</p>
                     <p>The proceedings upon a Statute Merchant are, That the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee may if he pleaſe bring his Statute to the Mayor, Clerk, or other Officer before whom it was acknowledged, and there if they find the record of it, and the day to be paſt for the payment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, they are to apprehend and impriſon the body of the Conuſor if he be a Lay-perſon, and can be found within their Juriſdiction. And if he cannot be found then, they are to certifie the Record into Chancery. And this they may be compelled to by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> if otherwiſe they refuſe to do it. And upon a <hi>Nihil</hi> returned upon a <hi>Teſtatum eſt,</hi> he may have proceſs into another County; but otherwiſe it is of goods: And if that Certificate be faulty, or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:97669:363"/>be not done upon it by reaſon of the Conuſees death or otherwiſe, the Conuſee or his Executor or Adminiſtrator may have another Certificate, and thereupon he ſhall have a Writ of <hi>Capias</hi> out of the Chancery directed to the Sheriff of the County where the Conuſor lives to apprehend and impriſon him (if he be not a Clergy-man) and this to be returned into the Kings Bench or Common-Pleas. And when the Conuſor is taken he ſhall have time for a quarter of a year to make his agreement with the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, and to ſell his Lands or Goods to ſatisfie him. And to that purpoſe he himſelf may ſell his Lands and Goods, although he be in priſon, and the ſale thereof will be good and lawful. But if in that time he do not ſatisfie the Conuſor, or if upon the <hi>Capias</hi> the Sheriff return a <hi>Non eſt inventus,</hi> then by another or divers Writs (if the Lands and Goods lye in divers Counties) called, <hi>Extendi facias</hi> to all the Sheriffs of the Counties where he hath Lands, whereby they ſhall be commanded to extend his Lands and goods, and to deliver the goods to him, and the Lands To hold to him and his heirs till the debt be levied or paid. And this Act of the Sheriff and Jury upon this Writ is called an Extent. And if the Sheriff or Appriſors upon the <hi>Extendi facias</hi> over-value the Lands or Goods in favour to the debtor, the Conuſee hath no remedy but by motion in that Court where the Writ is returnable at the Return day, or at leaſt the ſame Term, to deſire that the Appriſors may take the Lands or Goods at the rate they have valued them, in the ſame manner as the Coruſee is to have them. And a Sale made of Goods in this caſe by the Sheriff is as ſtrong as if it were in Market-overt. And when the Conuſee is in poſſeſſion of Lands by ſuch an Extent as before, then is he Tenant by Statute; And after the Conuſee is once ſetled in peace in the Lands extended, he ſhall hold them till he be ſatisfied his debt, and his reaſonable coſts and damages for travel, ſuit, delay and expence. See for this, <hi>Dyer</hi> 299. <hi>Co.</hi> 5.87. <hi>F.N.B.</hi> 130. <hi>Co.</hi> on <hi>Litt.</hi> 290. <hi>Co.</hi> 2. Part, <hi>Inſt.</hi> 395, 396.</p>
                     <p>The proceedings upon the other kinds of Recogniſances are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner. For upon Recognizances at the Common Law, if the money be not paid at the day, the Conuſee, his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor or Adminiſtrator is to bring a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Conuſor; or if he be dead, againſt his heir when he is of full age; or if the Lands the Conuſor had at the time of entring into the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance be ſold againſt the Purchaſors of them, which the Conuſor had at any time after the Recogniſance entred into, to warn them
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:97669:364"/>to come into the Court, whence the <hi>Scire facias</hi> iſſued, to ſhew cauſe why Execution ſhould not be made upon the ſaid Recogniſance: and if the party or parties cannot be ſound to be warned, or being warned do not appear at the time; or appearing do not ſhew cauſe why the debt ſhould not be levied: In this caſe the Conuſee ſhall have Execution of his moiety by <hi>Elegit,</hi> or if the Conuſor be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, of all his Goods by <hi>Levari</hi> or <hi>Fieri facias</hi> at his Election; but he may not have Execution of his Body, unleſs he bring an Action of Debt upon the Recogniſance (as in this caſe he may do) or it be by the courſe of the Court, as it is in the Kings Bench on a Bayl, wherein a <hi>Capias</hi> doth lye. <hi>Dyer</hi> 315, 360, 366.</p>
                     <p>The proceedings againſt the Sureties upon Statutes are to be in the ſame manner as the proceeding againſt the Principal: And yet where the Principal hath moveables to ſatisfie the debt, the Surety (as it ſeems) is not to be charged.</p>
                     <p>I will Illuſtrate this matter in the next place with ſome few Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And firſt,</p>

No more can Windowes and Doors hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the hooks, though they be removeable; but this muſt be found upon the ſame Land a man holds: but in other Lands not holden of him, he cannot diſtrain, except it be by the Tenants grant. If Diſmes be let reſerving a Rent, they cannot be diſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Rent, no not when they are ſevered from the nine parts, in as much as there is no diſtreſs but upon Land in demeſne.</p>

And being by Plaint, though in the County Court, it ſhall not proceed if any touching the Freehold come in queſtion; as if the Defendant avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for damage Feaſant, the Plaintiff juſtifieth by reaſon of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Paſture.</p>

                     <p>Upon a Return awarded to the Defendant, the Writ <hi>de Returno habendo</hi> ſhall have this Clauſe, (That the Sheriff ſhall not deliver them without Writ, wherein mention ſhall be made of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment). And thereupon the Plaintiff (if he will) may have a judicial Writ to the Sheriff to deliver him the Beaſts.</p>
